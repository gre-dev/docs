You can test a custom rule by using the `Test` button on right side of each custom rule. This will allow you to test the custom rule with a sample request and see if the conditions are met.

To test a custom rule, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">
    Go to the [Custom Rules page](https://dashboard.greip.io/custom-rules) from
    the account dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Step">
    From the dropdown menu on the right side of the custom rule you want to
    test, click on the `Test` button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Third Step">
    In the modal that appears on the screen, update the pre-filled sample
    response with the data you want to test. Then, click the `Apply the rule`
    button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fourth Step">
    The custom rule will be tested with the sample response you provided. If the
    conditions are met, the met actions will be displayed with details.
  </Step>
