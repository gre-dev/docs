## Overview

Webhooks are a way for your Greip account to communicate and send notifications to external services or applications in real-time. By adding webhook URLs to your account, you can receive immediate updates and notifications about important events and activities within the Greip API.

Webhooks play a vital role in enhancing the functionality and integration capabilities of Greip. They provide a seamless means to respond to events such as the detection of new Proxy Connection IP Addresses or the identification of fraudulent payments. With webhooks, you can stay informed about critical activities within your account and promptly take appropriate actions.

Webhooks enable you to leverage the power of external systems by receiving event-driven data and updates. By receiving notifications through webhooks, you can streamline your workflows, trigger automated responses, and gain real-time insights into the fraudulent activities detected by Greip. This integration helps you enhance your fraud prevention measures, safeguard your systems, and maintain a secure online environment for your business and customers.
