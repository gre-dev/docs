## Notes

- You can export as much data as you want, there's no limit applied to this feature.
- Wherever you lose the CSV file, you can always download it again from the events and alerts section, and this time it will be way faster because the data is already prepared.
- Make sure you set the correct filters before exporting the data, so you can get the most accurate results.
