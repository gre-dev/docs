## Ovewview

Multi-accounting is a common problem in applications where users can create multiple accounts to gain an unfair advantage. Greip can help you prevent multi-accounting by identifying users who have multiple accounts and taking appropriate action.

## The Integration Logic

### 1. IP Geolocation and Threat Intelligence

Endpoint: [`/geoip`](/api-reference/endpoint/data-lookup/geoip), [`/lookup/ip`](/api-reference/endpoint/data-lookup/ip), [`/lookup/ip/threats`](/api-reference/endpoint/scoring/ip-reputation)

**How it helps:**

Detect if multiple accounts are being created from the same IP address or a suspicious IP range.
Identify high-risk IPs (e.g., VPNs, proxies, Tor nodes) that are commonly used for multi-accounting.
Use the security module to check if the IP is associated with malicious activity.

### 2. Device Fingerprinting

Endpoint: [`/geoip`](/api-reference/endpoint/data-lookup/geoip) (with the device module)

**How it helps:**

Greip can provide device-related information (e.g., browser, OS, device type) that can be used to fingerprint devices.
If multiple accounts are being created from the same device, it could indicate multi-accounting.

### 3. Email and Phone Validation

Endpoints: [`/scoring/email`](/api-reference/endpoint/scoring/email), [`/scoring/phone`](/api-reference/endpoint/scoring/phone)

**How it helps:**

Detect disposable or temporary email addresses (common in multi-accounting).
Validate phone numbers to ensure they are legitimate and not reused across multiple accounts.
Flag suspicious email domains or phone numbers associated with fraud.

### 4. Payment Fraud Detection

Endpoint: [`/scoring/payment`](/api-reference/endpoint/scoring/payment)

**How it helps:**

Analyze payment details (e.g., credit card, billing address) to detect patterns of multi-accounting.
Identify if the same payment method is being used across multiple accounts.

### 5. ASN and BIN Lookup

Endpoints: [`/lookup/asn`](/api-reference/endpoint/data-lookup/asn), [/lookup/bin](/api-reference/endpoint/data-lookup/bin)

**How it helps:**

Detect if multiple accounts are being created from the same Autonomous System (ASN), which could indicate coordinated multi-accounting.
Validate credit card BINs to ensure they are not being reused fraudulently.

### 6. Profanity Detection

Endpoint: [`/scoring/profanity`](/api-reference/endpoint/scoring/profanity)

**How it helps:**

Detect if users are creating accounts with offensive or suspicious usernames, which could indicate multi-accounting for abusive purposes.

### 7. User Behavior Monitoring

**How it helps:**

Use the userID parameter to track requests and monitor user behavior across your platform.
Combine Greip data with your application’s logic to detect patterns of multi-accounting (e.g., multiple accounts created in a short time frame).

### Example Use Case: Multi-Accounting Detection

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1:">
    When a user creates an account, collect their IP address, email, phone
    number, and device information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2:">
    Use Greip’s [`/geoip`](/api-reference/endpoint/data-lookup/geoip) and
    [`/lookup/ip/threats`](/api-reference/endpoint/scoring/ip-reputation)
    endpoints to check if the IP is high-risk (e.g., VPN, proxy, or Tor).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3:">
    Validate the email using
    [`/scoring/email`](/api-reference/endpoint/scoring/email) to ensure it’s
    valid, correct, and not disposable.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 4:">
    Validate the phone number using
    [`/scoring/phone`](/api-reference/endpoint/scoring/phone) to ensure it’s
    legitimate and not disposable.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 5:">
    Check if the same IP, email, or phone number has been used for other
    accounts in your system.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 6:">
    Use [`/scoring/payment`](/api-reference/endpoint/scoring/payment) to analyze
    payment details for signs of fraud.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 7:">
    Flag or block accounts that exhibit suspicious patterns (e.g., multiple
    accounts from the same IP or device).
  </Step>
</Steps>
