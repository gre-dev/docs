## Overview

Payment fraud is a growing problem that affects businesses of all sizes and industries. Fraudsters are constantly evolving their tactics to bypass traditional fraud prevention measures. This is where Greip comes in. Greip is an advanced fraud prevention solution that helps businesses detect and prevent payment fraud in real-time.

## What is Payment Fraud?

Payment fraud is a type of fraud that involves the use of stolen payment information to make unauthorized transactions. It can take many forms, such as credit card fraud, account takeover fraud, and identity theft. Payment fraud can have serious consequences for businesses, including financial losses, damage to reputation, and legal liabilities.

Greip uses advanced machine learning algorithms to detect and prevent payment fraud in real-time. It analyzes user behavior and transaction data to identify suspicious activity and stop fraud before it happens. Greip is designed to be easy to integrate into your existing systems and can be customized to meet the specific needs of your business.

## The Integration Logic

Greip provide multiple approaches to empower you to detect and prevent payment fraud in real-time. Which approach you choose depends on your business needs and the level of fraud prevention you require. Here are some of the key features of Greip:

- **Pre-purchase Fraud Detection**: Greip can analyze user behavior and transaction data to identify suspicious activity before a purchase is made. This can help prevent fraudulent transactions from occurring in the first place and it can be done through the following endpoints:
  1. [Payment Fraud Detection](/api-reference/endpoint/scoring/payment): This endpoint allows you to score a transaction based on the likelihood of fraud. You can use this score to determine whether to accept or reject the transaction. When using this endpoint, try to provide as much information as possible about the transaction, so Greip can provide a comprehensive scoring result.
  2. [IP Reputation](/api-reference/endpoint/scoring/ip-reputation): This endpoint allows you to check the reputation of an IP address to determine whether it is associated with fraudulent activity.
  3. [IBAN Lookup](/api-reference/endpoint/data-lookup/iban): This endpoint allows you to validate an IBAN number to ensure that it is valid.
  4. [Email Risk Scoring](/api-reference/endpoint/scoring/email): This endpoint allows you to score the user email address based on the likelihood of fraud.
  5. [Phone Risk Scoring](/api-reference/endpoint/scoring/phone): This endpoint allows you to score the user phone number based on the likelihood of fraud.
- **Post-purchase Fraud Detection**: Greip can also analyze transaction data after a purchase is made to identify suspicious activity. This can help you detect and prevent fraud in real-time. These can be done through our [BIN/IIN Lookup](/api-reference/endpoint/data-lookup/bin) endpoint.

  <Tip>
    A common approuch is to use the BIN/IIN Lookup endpoint to check the card
    issuer country and compare it with the user's IP address country. If the two
    countries do not match, it could be a sign of fraud.
