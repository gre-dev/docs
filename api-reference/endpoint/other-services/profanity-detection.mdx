<Note>
This method returns a score for the text you pass.

We classify profanity into 4 different level. The first level contains the most risky words and phrases (risky). The second level contains the medium-risk words and phrases. Whereas, the third level contains the low-risk words.

When you use the API, the response will the determine the score of the text you passed as follows:

- `riskScore = 0` means that this text is completely safe.
- `riskScode = 1` means that this is a high-risk text.
- `riskScode = 2` means that this is a medium-risk text.
- `riskScode = 3` means that this is a low-risk text.
