Creating a [new account](https://www.gredev.io/en/portal/register) will automatically generate an API Key for you. So, the only thing you need to for using this service is to have an account.

After completing the registration process, you can go to:

[Dashboard](https://greip.io/dashboard/Home) -> [APIs](https://greip.io/dashboard/APIs)

Then copy the API Key under the "Fraud Prevention API" section.
