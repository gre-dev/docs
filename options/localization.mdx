Our API supports multiple languages, allowing you to retrieve responses in your native language. We understand the importance of providing an intuitive and user-friendly experience for your users, regardless of their language or location.

To retrieve responses in your desired language, simply add the `lang` parameter to your API request. This parameter allows you to choose from a range of supported languages, including `EN`, `AR`, `DE`, `FR`, `ES`, `JA`, `ZH`, and `RU`.

It's important to note that only specific fields of the response will be translated. However, we're continually working to expand our translation capabilities and add more languages to our API.

Let's take an example:

```
https://greipapi.com/geoip?key=1234567890&lang=RU
```

<Note>This feature is available only for specific endpoints.</Note>
