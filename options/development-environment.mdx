Our Development Environment offers a seamless integration process for our API with your website or application. To ensure that your current plan's available requests remain unaffected, we recommend implementing the integration by adding the &mode=test parameter to your request.

We highly recommend testing your integration thoroughly with the &mode=test parameter before removing it from your requests to ensure that everything is functioning as expected.

<Note>
  This parameter accepts two values, which are `test` and `live` and will be
  working for all our modules. <br />
  <br /> Please note that after setting this option to `test` you will get fake information,
  it's used just through the development stage.
</Note>

Once the integration process is complete, you can remove the "&mode=test" parameter from your API requests. This parameter is designed solely for testing purposes and has no impact on the actual functionality of the API.
