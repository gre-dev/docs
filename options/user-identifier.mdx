To identify users detected through our Dashboard, you need to include the ï»¿userID parameter in the requests you send to Greip. Let's look at some examples to illustrate this:

```
https://gregeoip.io/IPLookup?key=your-api-key&ip=1.1.1.1&userID=john@example.com
```

```
https://gregeoip.io/IPLookup?key=your-api-key&ip=1.1.1.1&userID=John
```

When you include the userID parameter in your requests to the Greip API, it allows you to identify and track fraudulent activities (found on the [Events page](https://dashboard.greip.io/events)) associated with specific user information such as user name, email address, phone number, and more.

<Warning>
**IMPORTAN NOTE**

There's no need to pass the userID parameter when you send [Payment Fraud Prevention](/api-reference/endpoint/scoring/payment) request to Greip API, as the User Identifier will be retreived from the input data you already pass, like `customer_email`, `customer_phone`, or `customer_id`.

</Warning>
